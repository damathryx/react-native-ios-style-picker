If you want to have the same user behaviour, you can use this.\n\nThe android component is based on https://github.com/AigeStudio/WheelPicker which runs super fast and smoothly. It also supports curved effect which make it exactly the same looking and feel as the ios picker.\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lesliesam/react-native-ios-style-picker/master/demo.gif)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lesliesam/react-native-ios-style-picker/master/demo_android.gif)\n\n## How to use\n\nRun command\n\nFor apps using RN 0.32 or higher, please run\n```\nnpm i react-native-ios-style-picker --save\n```\nFor apps using RN 0.31 or less, please run\n```\nnpm install --save --save-exact react-native-ios-style-picker\n```\nAdd in settings.gradle\n```\ninclude ':react-native-ios-style-picker'\nproject(':react-native-ios-style-picker').projectDir = new File(settingsDir, '../node_modules/react-native-ios-style-picker/android')\n```\nAdd in app/build.gradle\n```\ncompile project(':react-native-ios-style-picker')\n```\nModify MainActivity\n```\n    import com.zyu.ReactNativeWheelPickerPackage;\n    ......\n\n    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {\n        return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(\n            new MainReactPackage(), new ReactNativeWheelPickerPackage()\n        );\n    }\n```\n",
